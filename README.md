# Animated Eyes

## https://awhalen1999.github.io/animated-eyes/

An interactive animated face with eyes that follow your cursor and respond to keyboard shortcuts. (This animated face originally lived in another project. I broke it out into its own repo because its fun and it’s easier to share and build on.)
